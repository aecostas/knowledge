Protocols
==========================================

Sippojs provides 3 custom protocols using datapipes:

- **Selfie**:
- **Whiteboard**:
- **Forms**:

Each protocol defines custom messages to provide the funcionality.



Selfie
-------------

A selfie is created by the agent calling ``createSelfie`` function or by the client listening to the ``selfie-invite`` event, when some peer calls ``selfie.cancel()`` the datapipe is disconnected. This protocol defines the following messages:

- **selfie-invite** : Used to create a new selfie
- **taking:** Notify the agent that client is taking a selfie.
- **image:** Send the image to the agent.

::

	{
		command: "selfie-invite",
	}
	{
		command: "taking",
	}
	{
		command: "image",
		image: <base64Image>,
	}

Forms
-------------
A local form is created calling ``formTemplate.createForm()`` while a remote form is created listening to the ``incomingForm`` event.
This protocol defines the following messages:

- **form:** Used to create a new form, initializing name, fields, values...
- **value:** Update a field value.
- **focus:** Set remote focus on a field.
- **blur:** Remove the focus on a field.

::

	{
		cmd: "form",
		data: {
			id: <string>,
			name: <string>,
			fields: [<object>],
			values: [<string>]
		}
	}
	{
		cmd: "value",
		index: <int>,
		value: <string>,
	}
	{
		cmd: "focus",
		index: <int>,
	},
	{
		cmd: "blur",
		index: <int>,

A `local whiteboard is created ``session.createWhiteboard()` while a remote whiteboard is created listening to the ``incommingWhiteBoard`` event.
The whiteboard protocol has the following mesagges:

- ** shape:** Used to notify any event related with whiteboard: draw a new shape, select, erase...
- ** ready:** Launched when whiteboard is ready.

	{

	{
		cmd: "shape",
		type: "line",
		id: <id>,
		path: [<point>],
		stroke: <color>,
		fill: <color>,
	}
	{
		cmd: "shape",
		type: "freedraw",
		id: <id>,
		path: [<point>],
		stroke: <color>,
		fill: <color|none>,
	}
	{
		cmd: "shape",
		type: "circle",
		id: <id>,
		cx:<point>,
		cy:<point>,
		r: <float>,
		stroke: <color>,
		fill: <color>,
	}
	{
